## Why Quizpot?

* **Zero Learning Curve**: Quizpot provides a streamlined, user-friendly experience that feels natural from the very first click, but without the artificial restrictions.
* **Your Hardware, Your Rules:** Take it to the next level by hosting it on your own infrastructure.
* **Real-time Interaction:** Powered by a dedicated WebSocket server for instant, low-latency question delivery.
* **Privacy by Design:** Quizpot is built with a "zero-persistence" philosophy. 
    * **No Data Collection:** We don't store your personal info or quiz data on the server long-term.
    * **Client-Side Storage:** Everything is saved directly in your browser. Once the session is over, the server holds nothing.
* **Device Agnostic:** A seamless, responsive experience for players on mobile, tablet, or desktop browsers — no app downloads required.
* **Unlimited Freedom:** Create as many quizzes and host as many players as your hardware can handle. No hidden limits on participant counts.
